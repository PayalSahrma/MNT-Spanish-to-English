# MNT-Spanish-to-English
Background: Due to language barriers, a US-based life insurance company is facing a challenge in communicating with the Spanish-speaking community in Mexico. The locals there need help in understanding English, and the company cannot provide translators for all of them. To overcome this challenge and provide coverage to the locals, the company needs a machine translation model that can accurately translate the application request letter from Spanish to English.

Problem Statement: Your task is to build an attention-based sequence-to-sequence model that can effectively understand the context of Spanish sentences and translate them into clear and coherent English sentences. The company aims to use this model to ensure seamless communication and provide coverage to the Spanish-speaking community in Mexico.

Objectives: To explore the challenges of working with low-resource languages. Implement an encoder-decoder NMT model with attention.

Terminal Objective: To build and train an NMT model that can accurately translate Spanish sentences to English and vice versa.

Overall objectives:
The objective of this assignment is to build a Sequence to Sequence model for Spanish to English translation.

The code is broken down into several pipelines:

Task 1: Load the data
Task 2: Process the data
Task 3: Build the NMT model
Task 4: Train the NMT model
Task 5: Evaluate the NMT model
*Note: the details of each of the above task are elaborated in various parts of this stub code.
